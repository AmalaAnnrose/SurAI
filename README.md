# SurAI@StacsHack 2017
An Alexa AI to take surveys. This can enable Alexa to ask questions in a survey and record all the answers in DynamoDB on AWS. A highlight of this project is that this design targets the blind people very well. It is extremely blind-friendly and it helps with research or survey that involves the blind.
