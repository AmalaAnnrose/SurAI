# SurAI@StacsHack 2017 on Amazon Alexa
An Amazon Alexa AI to take surveys. This project can enable Alexa to ask a set of questions in a survey and record all the answers from participants in DynamoDB on Amazon Website Services (AWS) automatically. The whole process is done through conversation and sound recognition technology provided by Alexa. Then responses from Alexa are processed by AWS lambda computing. 

A highlight of this project is that this design targets the blind people very well. It is extremely blind-friendly and it helps with research or survey that involves the blind.
