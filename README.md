# SurAI@StacsHack 2017
An Amazon Alexa AI to take surveys. This project can enable Alexa to ask a set of questions in a survey and record all the answers from participants in DynamoDB on Amazon Website Services (AWS) automatically. The responses from Alexa are processed by AWS lambda computing. 

A highlight of this project is that this design targets the blind people very well. It is extremely blind-friendly and it helps with research or survey that involves the blind.
